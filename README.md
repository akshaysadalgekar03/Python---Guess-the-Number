# Python---Guess-the-Number

## What is this game?
This is a guess-the-number game written in Python. The python program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the player and the player must correctly guess the correct number. If the playersâ€™s guess is wrong, the program returns error message and is asked to guess the number again. If the player guesses correctly, a positive message is displayed and game ends.
